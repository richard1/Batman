# _Batman_

Registration system for Bellarmine's 2013 justice summit breakout sessions. 
Based primarily on PHP and MySQL, but uses a bit of Javascript. 
Guides over 1600 students through the process of registering for 3 of 86 possible sessions, given restrictions based on grade and timeslot-specific complications. 
Features a convenient printable roster-generator, an auto-filling script to automatically sign stragglers up for sessions, and a printable list of a student's sessions. 

Built as a project for the Fall 2012 Web Application Development class.
